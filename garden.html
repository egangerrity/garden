  <p>There are several community gardens on Staten Island, many of which provide fresh produce to local charities, including Project Hospitality. For a fee, most will provide you with a plot of land, provided you maintain it and share some of your harvest those less fortunate. Here are a few:
</p></div>

<div class="main">
<p><b>Staten Island Moravian Community Garden</b> About half of this garden, located behind the Castleton Hill Moravian Church's parsonage at 1646 Victory Blvd., Castleton Corners, supplies Project Hospitality. The garden features 16 personal plots. A recruitment meeting for potential gardeners will be held April 13 in the church.  Volunteers are always welcome.  For information, call the garden coordinator at 718-442-5215.
</p>

<div class="main">
<p><b>Joe Holzka Community Garden </b> The garden sits on the corner of Castleton Avenue and Barker Street in West Brighton. The garden is a city Parks Department Green Thumb garden, and donates produce to the pantry run by Community Health Action of Staten Island.

</p></div>

<div class="main">
<p><b>West Brighton Community Garden </b> On the corner of Henderson Avenue and Chappell Street sits the West Brighton Community Garden. Built as part of the 2014 Gardens for Healthy Communities program as part of the Mayor's Obesity Task Force Initiative, the 9,000-square foot garden is located near Corporal Thompson Park and next to the West Brighton Swimming Pool.  It features 25 raised garden beds and picnic tables. Reach out to 311 for contact information.
</p></div>

<div class="main">
<p><b>Westervelt Community Garden </b> is owned and operated by The New York Restoration Project, a cleaning and greening initiative funded by grants and individual giving. In the front of the garden, mature trees provide shade for local residents and visitors, while resourceful local gardeners may grow vegetables and herbs. A picnic table and grill in the back of the space make it an ideal location for barbecues and community gatherings. If interested in using the space, free of charge, or gardening in the space, call 212-333-2552 , or go to  www.nyrp.org/green spaces.
